# REVa (Robustness Enhancement via Validation)
REVa is a two-part enhancement procedure for deep learning classifiers. First, it evaluates models on adversarial and corruption datasets generated from weak robust samples. Then, it uses the evaluation outcomes to guide targeted improvements in model robustness.
